# uq-method-box

A set of datasets and models to evaluate predictive uncertainty on regression tasks. As a PyTorch library it relies heavily on PytorchLightning and GPytorch.
The goal of this library is threefold:

1. Provde access to a variety of Uncertainty Quantification methods for Modern Deep Neural Networks that work with a range of models.
2. Make it easy to compare methods on a new dataset or a new method on existing datasets.
3. Focus on reproducibility of experiments with miminum boiler plate code and standardized evaluation protocols.

## Documentation 
We aim to provide an extensive documentation on all included UQ-methods to clearly state assumptions and pitfalls, as well as tutorials that illustrate these. 

## Experiments
The experiments conducted for our paper "Title here." are contained in the [experiments](experiments/) directory. To reproduce the results in our paper follow these instructions.
