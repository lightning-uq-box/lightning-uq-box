# Tutorials

The tutorials have two central goals:

1. Briefly introduce the idea of any particual UQ-Method
2. Show how you can apply and adapt these methods for your use case

1D Regression tutorials have the advantage that they are able to illustrate some concepts visually so they are generally a good place to start, however, we aim to provide tutorials for a wide variety of applications. The tutorial notebooks can also be run on google colab, by clicking on the little rocket icon at the top of the page. Just run `! pip install git+https://github.com/lightning-uq-box/lightning-uq-box.git` at the beginning to install all necessary dependencies.
