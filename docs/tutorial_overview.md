# Tutorials

The tutorials have two central goals:

1. Briefly introduce the idea and theory of any particual UQ-Method
2. Show how you can apply and adapt these methods for your use case

The UQ-Methods can vary across application tasks, so if you prefer an overview categorized by that, you can head over to [this page](method_overview). 1D Regression tutorials have the advantage that they are able to illustrate some concepts visually so they are generally a good place to start.
