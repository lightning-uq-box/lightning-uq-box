# Application of UQ-Methods by Task

There exist a wide variety of UQ-Methods. Similarly, there are several general tasks for which practicioners might require uncertainty estimates. The library currently supports the following four tasks:

1. **Regression** for tabular/image inputs with 1D scalar targets
2. 2D Regression / **Pixel Wise Regression**
3. **Classification** for tabular/image inputs with single classification label
4. **Segmentation** where each pixel is assigned a class

While some UQ-Methods like MC-Dropout or Deep Ensembles can be applied across tasks, other methods are specifically developed for certain tasks. The following aims to give an overview of supported methods for the different tasks.

Currently, Lightning-UQ-Box supports the following models and tasks:

- ✅ supported
- ❌ not designed for this task
- ⏳ in progress
