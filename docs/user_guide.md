# Why lightning-uq-box

Over the past decade open-sourcing code alongside publications has luckily become a defacto standard. However, different papers continue to reimplemnt and develop methods in their own frameworks with a lot of boilerplate code. This can make it difficult to understand what the core aspects of a proposed method are. Additionally, this makes is more time-consuming to test various methods on your task of interests as each implementation might have different requirements and custom functionality. We aim to bridge this gap with the lightning-uq-box, which is essentially nothing more than a collection of [Lightning Modules](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/lightning_module.html). The Lightning framework has seen tremendously increased adaption from the research community over the past years due to lettting researchers focus on the essence of their research instead of writing boilerplate code.
