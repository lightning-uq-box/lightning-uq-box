# Tutorials

The tutorials have two central goals:

1. Briefly introduce the idea and theory of any particual UQ-Method
2. Show how you can apply and adapt these methods for your use case

The UQ-Methods can vary across application tasks, so if you prefer an overview categorized by that, you can head over to [this page](application_by_task). 1D Regression tutorials have the advantage that they are able to illustrate some concepts visually so they are generally a good place to start.

## Introductory Topics

The introductory topics aim to give an overview of common baseline UQ-Methods. They provide a set of basic UQ tools that are generally easily applicable and can form strong baselines.

Additionally, we want to give a rough classification of the different methods to illustrate their common theoretical underpinning and the assumptions they make.

## Classification of UQ-Methods

The following aims to give an overview of different UQ-Methods by grouping them according to some commonalities. We agree that there could be other groupings as well and welcome suggestions to improve this overview. We also follow this grouping for the API documentation in the hopes to make navigation easier.

### Single Forward Pass Methods

### Approximate Bayesian Methods

### Ensemble Methods
