# Tutorials

The tutorials have two central goals:

1. Briefly introduce the idea and theory of any particual UQ-Method
2. Show how you can apply and adapt these methods for your use case

## Introductory Topics

The introductory topics aim to give an overview of common baseline UQ-Methods. They provide a set of basic UQ tools that are generally easily applicable and can form strong baselines.

## Advanced Topics

The advanced topics introduce some UQ methods that go beyond the "basic" set of tools in a Deep Learning UQ toolbox. We aim to provide a basic theoretical introduction to these methods and put some specific emphasis on tunable hyperparameters within these approaches.
