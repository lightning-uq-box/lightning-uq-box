    "The Laplace Approximation was originally introduced by [MacKay, 1992](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/13793/1/MACnc92b.pdf). Then, the Laplace Approximation has been adapted to modern neural networks by [Ritter, 2018](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10080902/1/kflaplace.pdf) and [Daxberger, 2021](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/daxberger21a/daxberger21a.pdf) and is an approximate Bayesian method. The goal of the Laplace Approximation is to use a second-order Taylor expansion around the fitted MAP estimate and yield a posterior approximation over the model parameters via a full-rank, diagonal or Kronecker-factorized approach. In order for the Laplace Approximation to be computationally feasible for larger network architectures, we use the [Laplace library](https://aleximmer.github.io/Laplace/) to include approaches, such as subnetwork selection that have been for example proposed by [Daxberger, 2021](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/daxberger21a/daxberger21a.pdf).\n",

    "The general idea of the Laplace Approximation to obtain a distribution over the network parameters is to approximate the posterior with a Gaussian distribution centered at the MAP estimate of the parameters [Daxberger, 2021](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/daxberger21a/daxberger21a.pdf). In this setting, we define a prior distribution $p(\\theta)$ over our network parameters. Because modern neural networks consists of millions of parameters, obtaining a posterior distribution over the weights $\\theta$ is intractable. The LA takes MAP estimate of the parameters $\\theta_{MAP}$ from a trained network $f_{\\theta_{MAP}}(x) = \\mu_{\\theta_{MAP}}(x)$ and constructs a Gaussian distribution around it. The parameters $\\theta_{MAP}$ are obtained by\n",

Then with Bayes Theorem, as in  [Daxberger, 2021](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/daxberger21a/daxberger21a.pdf), one can relate the posterior to the loss,\n",

For small networks like in this example, one can fit the Laplace approximation over all weights, but this is not feasible for large million-parameter networks. In those cases, on can resort to a \"last-layer\" approximation, where only the last layer weights are stochastic, while all other weights are deterministic. This behavior is controlled with the `subset_of_weights` parameter. This is chosen in combination with the structure of the Hessian that is fitted, see the `hessian_structure` parameter. Check their documentation for details. The Lightning-UQ-Box provides a wrapper so that the workflow is the same as with any other implemented UQ-Method.\n",
