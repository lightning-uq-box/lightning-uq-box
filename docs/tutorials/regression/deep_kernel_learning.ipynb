Following [Seeger, 2004](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0129065704001899), consider the simple special case where the observations are noise free and you have training data $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{train}} = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{K}$ with $X=(x_i)_{i=1}^K$ and $Y=(y_i)_{i=1}^K$.

DKL combines GPs and DNNs in a scalable way. In practice, all parameters, the weights of the feature extractor and the GP parameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the log marginal likelihood of the GP. We utilize GPytorch for our implementation [Gardner, 2018](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/27e8e17134dd7083b050476733207ea1-Paper.pdf) and use a grid approximation where we optimized over the number of inducing points.
